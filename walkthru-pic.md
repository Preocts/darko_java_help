# Straight to the steps then!

### Setting up the Twitch App

1. Open the Twitch Launcher
2. Click the three lines in the upper left corner and select File > Settings
3. Click the Minecraft Tab
4. Scroll down until you see "**Launcher Method**"
   - Make sure "Native Launcher" is selected here
5. Scroll down until you see "**Additional Arguments**"
   - **Add** the following to the textbox:
   - ```-version:1.8+```

### Making sure Java is up-to-date

1. Download the latest **64bit** Java 8 version from [https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp](https://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp)
2. Run the installer you just downloaded
3. If prompted: Uninstall Out-of-Date Java versions

That's it. At this point when you launch a mod-pack from the Twitch App it will use the new version of Java you just installed. Smile.
