## F.A.Q.

**That disclaimer seems scary, should I be worried?**

- I didn't write it to scare you. Read the directions, follow the directions, and you'll be fine.

**Why upgrade Java?**

- Many reasons but mainly to take advantage of security patches and performance improvements.

**One of these walk-thrus takes me to java dot com while the rest take me to a place called AdoptOpenJDK, what gives?**

- The walk-thru for Twitch Launcher requires the Java Run-time Environment (JRE) because the launcher doesn't allow manually selecting a java install.  All other downloads are for the Java Development Kit (JDK) which is easier to obtain, install, and maintain from AdoptOpenJDK (my opinion).

**Do I have to uninstall anything?**

- You should only have one version of Java installed at a given time to ensure all programs use the newest version.  This is not a requirement, but a strong suggestion.

**Is it, in fact, Darkosto's birthday?**
- Chances are slim.
