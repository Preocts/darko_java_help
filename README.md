# Updating Twitch App Minecraft Java Version Use

#### The purpose of these documents is to assist you with ensuring that the Twitch App launches Minecraft with the newest version of Java 8 versus the bundled Java version for mod-pack play enjoyment.

**Standard Disclaimer**: As with anything found online, I recommend you research your problem and the solutions suggested. These documents will have you installing, and possibly uninstalling, a program to your computer. The creator of this document and anyone who serves these documents cannot take responsibility to the functionality of your computer.

**Assumption**: The assumption is made that you already have the Twitch App installed and have your desired mod-pack downloaded. Those tasks are outside the scope of these documents.
